The authors assemble 35 papers (41 studies; 112 interventions; ~87,000 participants) and restrict inclusion to RCTs with minimum sample sizes and non-immediate behavioral outcomes, then synthesize using robust variance estimation (RVE). Major strengths include the focus on behavior (not attitudes/intentions), careful separation of net MAP versus red/processed meat (RPM) outcomes, longest-follow-up extraction to emphasize persistence, transparent handling of multi-arm studies via RVE with small-sample correction, publication-bias analyses using both selection models and a “worst-case” non-affirmative subset, and unusually strong computational reproducibility (Rmarkdown, containerization, public repository). The headline finding—a small pooled impact on net MAP consumption (SMD≈0.07, 95% CI [0.02, 0.12]) that attenuates further under publication-bias corrections (≈0.01–0.02)—is consistently and cautiously characterized. Still, several methodological and reporting choices merit attention. First, three inclusion decisions were made after data collection began (creating a separate RPM category; excluding substitution-only interventions; excluding settings without voluntary choice). These appear defensible and are disclosed, but they introduce a modest risk of researcher degrees of freedom and could shift the study mix toward certain settings or mechanisms; a preregistered protocol would mitigate this concern in future iterations. Second, the requirement of a “pure control” arm excludes a number of quasi-experimental or active-control designs common in institutional food environments; this choice improves internal validity but may lower external validity for policy-relevant defaults and operational nudges. Third, all data extraction was conducted by a single coder; while the authors consulted public datasets or contacted authors when uncertain, the lack of independent double-coding and inter-rater reliability checks increases the risk of extraction or coding errors (especially for complex effect-size conversions and intervention categorization). Fourth, when sufficient information to compute a standardized mean difference (SMD) was lacking and the text reported a “null,” outcomes were set to an “unspecified null” of 0.01. This imputation is transparent but ad hoc; it could bias pooled estimates upward (relative to zero) and may not reflect the true variance of those effects. The manuscript would benefit from sensitivity checks setting these to 0, excluding them, or modeling them with conservative variances. Fifth, the chosen primary effect-size metric is Glass’s Δ standardized on the control-group SD (preferably pre-treatment). While often reasonable, many included RCTs likely lack pre-treatment consumption SDs, and cross-study variability in control SDs can induce additional heterogeneity; the paper does not report sensitivity to using Hedges’ g with small-sample correction or to odds-ratio/logit-based metrics for binary outcomes. The text notes standard conversions for regression-based and discrete outcomes, but more detail on the exact formulas, handling of cluster designs, and any small-sample corrections would improve reproducibility and comparability. Sixth, the RVE meta-analytic approach is appropriate for dependent effect sizes, but the assumed within-study correlation (rho) is not reported; typical practice is to vary rho (e.g., 0.2–0.9) to show robustness. Subgroup and moderator analyses with very small k (notably choice architecture, k=2 studies, 3 estimates) produce extremely imprecise estimates; these are presented with wide CIs, but readers would benefit from explicit caution against overinterpretation. Seventh, publication-bias methods (Vevea–Hedges selection model and the non-affirmative subset approach) generally assume independence of effects; it is not fully clear whether dependence was addressed (e.g., by collapsing to one effect per study for these specific analyses). If not, standard errors may be anti-conservative. Eighth, while the authors emphasize that many outcomes are self-reported and susceptible to social desirability bias, the main results do not stratify by measurement type (objective vs. self-report) nor systematically examine follow-up duration as a moderator, despite extracting “longest follow-up” per intervention; both could influence effect sizes and real-world relevance. Ninth, cluster-randomized trials were included contingent on ≥10 clusters, but the extraction section does not detail whether effect sizes and standard errors were adjusted for clustering when primary reports did not do so; misalignment here could affect weighting. Tenth, the intervention taxonomy (choice architecture, persuasion, psychology, combined) is reasonable, but many interventions span multiple categories, complicating subgroup interpretation; the authors appropriately eschew meta-regression by theory, but this leaves open questions about differential efficacy by mechanism beyond simple stratification. On interpretation, the paper’s central claim—net MAP reduction remains an unsolved problem—is well justified by both the small pooled effects and the bias-corrected estimates, together with the observed decline in effects over time and stronger effects when focusing on RPM only (with unresolved substitution risk). The discussion appropriately notes improved methodological trends, gaps in evaluated strategies (e.g., pricing, defaults with longer follow-up, contact with animals, disgust-based messaging), and the need to measure compensatory behaviors across meals or days. Presentation and logic are clear; figures and tables support the narrative; minor textual redundancies and a few typographical repetitions do not impede comprehension. Open-science practices are a notable strength: a DOI-linked repository, documented code and data, and containerization substantially lower replication barriers, though inclusion of a data dictionary for all coded variables, explicit mapping of each effect-size transformation, and a machine-readable PRISMA log would further enhance reuse. Overall, the work persuasively reframes expectations about behavioral MAP-reduction interventions, carefully distinguishes RPM-focused outcomes from net MAP, and shows commendable transparency. The main limitations—single-coder extraction, ad hoc handling of “unspecified nulls,” incomplete reporting of some meta-analytic assumptions, and limited moderator detail on measurement/follow-up—temper but do not overturn the conclusions. The paper provides a reliable, policy-relevant synthesis that is likely to influence both research prioritization and practice, especially in encouraging larger, longer, and more behaviorally rigorous trials with objective outcomes and full accounting for substitution and compensation.\",\"metrics\":{\"overall\":{\"midpoint\":80,\"lower_bound\":72,\"upper_bound\":88},\"claims_evidence\":{\"midpoint\":80,\"lower_bound\":72,\"upper_bound\":87},\"methods\":{\"midpoint\":75,\"lower_bound\":67,\"upper_bound\":83},\"advancing_knowledge\":{\"midpoint\":80,\"lower_bound\":70,\"upper_bound\":88},\"logic_communication\":{\"midpoint\":87,\"lower_bound\":80,\"upper_bound\":93},\"open_science\":{\"midpoint\":90,\"lower_bound\":82,\"upper_bound\":97},\"global_relevance\":{\"midpoint\":85,\"lower_bound\":77,\"upper_bound\":92},\"tier_should\":{\"score\":4.3,\"ci_lower\":3.6,\"ci_upper\":4.8},\"tier_will\":{\"score\":3.9,\"ci_lower\":3.2,\"ci_upper\":4.5}}}",
