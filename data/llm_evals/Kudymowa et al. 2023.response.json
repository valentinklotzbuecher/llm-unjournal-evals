The manuscript’s core contributions are: (i) retaining an SRTP framing while articulating why SOC and harmonizing approaches are less suitable in this context; (ii) clarifying the unit being discounted in GiveWell-style modeling (consumption growth rather than levels) and deriving an explicit, adapted wealth-effect formula r = δ + (η − 1)g; (iii) identifying and correcting a minor computational error in the prior spreadsheet implementation; (iv) proposing a defensible, transparent procedure to estimate g using a population-weighted SSA+SA composite and a time-window anchored to program effect duration, with an update cadence; and (v) highlighting an important internal inconsistency: using η = 1 in the utility implicit in CEAs (log utility) while using η = 1.59 for the wealth-effect component, which can materially alter the overall rate. The report also reviews discounting for health outcomes, pure time preference, temporal uncertainty, and a “compounding non-monetary benefits” component. The overall structure is logical and the reasoning is mostly transparent, with useful appendices on derivations and institutional practice.\\n\\nKey issues and limitations arise primarily from evidence depth, parameterization rigor, and potential internal inconsistencies that are flagged but not resolved. First, the choice to keep SRTP over SOC is broadly reasonable for cross-intervention welfare comparisons, but the paper does not quantify the decision stakes of alternative approaches (e.g., implementing an SOC-based sensitivity case or the SPC/weighted-average harmonization to show how rankings or absolute valuations would change for representative interventions). Given the centrality of this decision, readers would benefit from explicit comparative numerics under plausible parameterizations and program archetypes (consumption vs mortality vs morbidity outcomes) and explicit discussion of potential crowding-out magnitudes for philanthropic funds across feasible counterfactuals.\\n\\nSecond, the adaptation r = δ + (η − 1)g is a valuable clarification of what is implicitly being discounted in these CEAs; however, the implications are only partially explored. The report rightly notes that adopting a consistent η across the entire modeling stack is crucial to avoid overdiscounting, and that if η = 1 were used consistently, the wealth effect falls to zero. Because this change alone can shift the overall rate by ~1.7–2.0 percentage points and potentially alter program rankings, the absence of a worked re-estimation of a few headline CEAs (or at least a stylized demonstration of ranking sensitivity) leaves a major decision lever underexplored. Relatedly, the suggestion to include either donor or beneficiary pure time preference, but not both, is correct; yet, no quantitative illustration is provided for plausible donor-weighting choices, which would illuminate how sensitive choices are to stakeholder perspective.\\n\\nThird, the proposed method for estimating g (3.3%) is transparent but rests on several judgement calls that deserve more robustness checks. The SSA+SA population-weighted composite and 40-year window tied to deworming are reasonable, but the paper itself flags a puzzling result: the composite CAGR lying below that of both components over part of the horizon and tracking SA closely; this could arise from weighting, smoothing, or interpolation choices. The authors acknowledge limited time to resolve the anomaly, which weakens confidence. Additional triangulation would strengthen the recommendation: e.g., comparing alternative global forecasts (beyond IMF and Goldman Sachs), decomposing growth into productivity and demographics, checking sensitivity to funding-allocation weights versus population weights, and testing alternative horizon widths (20, 30, 50 years) and start/end-year anchoring. The proposed 5.2-year update cadence is pragmatic, but the threshold (0.1 pp change warranting an update) is ad hoc; a justification aligned with decision-value or threshold cost-effectiveness changes would be preferable.\\n\\nFourth, recommendations on non-consumption components are mixed in strength. For δ, the report synthesizes philosophical and empirical arguments well and makes a defensible case for δ = 0 in this application. For temporal uncertainty (1.4%), and especially for the “compounding non-monetary benefits” (0.9%), the evidential base is thin. The temporal uncertainty component is broadly aligned with other estimates but mixes existential/catastrophic risks with other pathways to benefit non-realization in a way that risks double counting with other parts of the CEA (e.g., baseline mortality, fade-out) unless carefully separated. The 0.9% non-monetary compounding term is acknowledged to be weakly justified and partly a historical compromise; no alternative modeling frameworks (e.g., explicit dynamic household investment pathways, or SPC-style reinvestment for the relevant subset of benefits) are trialed. Given these components together account for more than half of the overall rate in some parameterizations (especially if η were set to 1), their uncertainty deserves more structured analysis (e.g., priors, ranges, and decision-relevant sensitivity).\\n\\nFifth, the health-vs-consumption discounting section captures the state of the literature accurately: equal discounting remains common, but arguments for discounting health at a lower rate are stronger conceptually; nevertheless, the report does not specify a practicable health rate beyond continuing to apply temporal uncertainty only. This conservative, “status-quo-with-justification” recommendation is understandable, but it would be more decision-useful to propose at least a small set of candidate health rates with transparent assumptions (e.g., under additively separable utility versus specific non-separable forms), plus implications for representative interventions.\\n\\nSixth, while the manuscript is technically careful—the correction of a spreadsheet formula and explicit derivations are strong points—reproducibility for applied users depends on linked spreadsheets and external projections. The report references online resources but does not embed full data snapshots or code within the document; version control, a frozen dataset appendix, and a worked example reproducing the 4.3% rate calculation end-to-end would enhance replicability. Some internal consistency concerns remain: clear separation of units (utils vs consumption levels vs log consumption) is emphasized, but readers might still find it challenging to trace how each component maps to the unit actually discounted in different CEA modules. Finally, the institutional scan is informative but shallow by design (~10 hours), relying on convenience samples and email inquiries; conclusions drawn from that scan should be treated as suggestive rather than definitive.\\n\\nOverall, the report advances clarity on a few pivotal modeling choices (unit of discounting, η consistency, explicit wealth-effect formula, and a more principled g estimate and update process), provides a balanced and transparent discussion of contested components, and responsibly flags uncertainties. The main weaknesses are the limited depth of quantitative robustness, reliance on a few external forecasts without triangulation, unresolved anomalies in growth aggregation, and the absence of sensitivity demonstrations on headline program rankings for high-stakes parameter changes (notably η and the inclusion/exclusion/magnitude of the 0.9% component). These limitations are typical for an applied advisory report on a tight timeline, but they constrain generalizability. With additional analyses that quantify decision-sensitivity and resolve the growth-aggregation puzzle, the work could serve as a stronger reference for the broader global health CEA
