The approach is transparent in intent—predicting potential, not feasibility—but several methodological choices and data limitations affect inference strength and precision. The dependent variable (presence/absence of natural regeneration during 2000–2016) is derived from a prior global remote-sensing classification that conservatively emphasized omission errors in humid regions and required a minimum patch size; area-based producer accuracy for natural regrowth in the humid biome was low while user accuracy for detected patches was high. This means the positive training class is a non-random subset of true regrowth, with systematic under-detection likely concentrated in particular forest types, geographies, and patch sizes. The predictive model then inherits these detection and sampling biases, potentially distorting learned relationships and shifting mapped potential away from contexts where regrowth was common but poorly detected. Model fitting uses random forests on millions of stratified points, with a sensible variable-selection procedure; predictions are ultimately based on biophysical predictors alone because a combined socioecological model yielded very similar accuracy. Omitting socioeconomic predictors makes the maps more temporally stable and widely available, but it also reframes outputs as “biophysical potential” and risks overpredicting potential in places where human pressure or governance constraints are binding. Validation emphasizes overall accuracy around 88% using a balanced validation set; however, accuracy declines at moderate distances from training locations, indicating residual spatial autocorrelation and some optimism in headline accuracy. The use of accuracy rather than threshold-free metrics, and the balancing of classes (prevalence set to 50%) during training and validation, further complicates interpretation of both accuracy and the calibration of predicted probabilities. The paper interprets the continuous model output as a probability and converts this to “expected area” by multiplying by pixel area and summing, yielding 215 Mha. Yet the calibration of random-forest scores to true probabilities is not established; without calibration (e.g., isotonic or Platt scaling) under the real-world prevalence, the expected-area identity may be biased. The extraordinarily narrow “confidence intervals” reported for area (±0.22 Mha at global scale) are not credible statistical uncertainty; they reflect computational or rounding artifacts, not propagation of uncertainty from training data errors, cross-validated prediction error, input-layer uncertainty, or probability calibration. A threshold (>0.5) sensitivity shows a substantially larger area, highlighting dependence on interpretation choices. Many predictors are coarse (250 m–1 km) while predictions are at 30 m; this scale mismatch introduces blockiness and may overstate local precision. The domain of “available for restoration” is defined liberally by excluding only forests, water, urban, bare, and forestry areas; while appropriate for modeling, its presentation alongside country totals risks being misread as areas that are socially or legally available for reforestation. Temporal assumptions also matter: the model projects to 2015/2030 by assuming that 2000–2016 relationships hold and by updating some forest-context layers with 2018 data; it does not incorporate climate change trajectories, shifting fire regimes, or evolving socioeconomics that strongly affect regeneration and permanence. Carbon estimates are calculated by downscaling a 1 km accumulation dataset to 30 m, multiplying by modeled potential, and summing; the stated range lacks a clearly defined uncertainty model and appears not to propagate classification, calibration, or permanence risks. The paper is commendably explicit that realized sequestration will be lower due to leakage, reclearance, and policy constraints, yet some statements comparing potential annual removals to current pantropical losses could be interpreted too strongly given these omitted risks and uncertainties. Spatial performance is uneven, with lower accuracy in parts of Southeast Asia; country and biome summaries lack uncertainty decomposition, which would be useful for decision makers. On replicability, large gridded outputs are publicly archived and inputs are open, but code is available only upon request; combined with the volume of preprocessing, this raises barriers to full reproduction, code review, and extension. Strengths include a clearly articulated objective focused on actionable planning, a very large training sample, careful variable selection, explicit treatment of autocorrelation effects (even if not using full spatial block cross-validation), and extensive caveats about use and governance. The resulting layers will be highly valuable as a first-pass screen for assisted natural regeneration opportunities and for national restoration dialogues. The main improvements needed relate to uncertainty characterization (probability calibration, spatially explicit error propagation, and country-level error budgets), spatial cross-validation that reduces spatial leakage, clearer separation of statistical precision from conceptual ranges, dynamic scenario analysis including plausible climate and human-pressure changes, and full open release of code. Overall, this is an influential, practically useful mapping contribution with limitations that mainly concern probabilistic interpretation, uncertainty, and temporal and socioecological external validity.\",\"metrics\":{\"overall\":{\"midpoint\":86,\"lower_bound\":86,\"upper_bound\":86},\"claims_evidence\":{\"midpoint\":78,\"lower_bound\":78,\"upper_bound\":78},\"methods\":{\"midpoint\":74,\"lower_bound\":74,\"upper_bound\":74},\"advancing_knowledge\":{\"midpoint\":92,\"lower_bound\":92,\"upper_bound\":92},\"logic_communication\":{\"midpoint\":84,\"lower_bound\":84,\"upper_bound\":84},\"open_science\":{\"midpoint\":63,\"lower_bound\":63,\"upper_bound\":63},\"global_relevance\":{\"midpoint\":94,\"lower_bound\":94,\"upper_bound\":94},\"tier_should\":{\"score\":4.4,\"ci_lower\":4.4,\"ci_upper\":4.4},\"tier_will\":{\"score\":4.8,\"ci_lower\":4.8,\"ci_upper\":4.8}}}",
