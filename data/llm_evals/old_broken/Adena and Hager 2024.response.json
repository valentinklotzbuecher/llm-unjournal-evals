There are uncertainties from aggregator-level measurements and fluctuations in donation levels that lead to borderline significance for revenue, despite their use of a large sample.\n\nThey use a \"lagged dependent variable\" effectively alongside randomization. However, the ROI calculation using a lifetime value of 1.75 seems overly optimistic, ignoring creative and staffing costs. \n\nThe intermediate metrics do not effectively link to outcomes due to failed tracking.

The absence of a treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effect or dose-response metric means that patterns observed between “free vs. fixed” and “empathy vs. effectiveness” rely on limited power and aggregated metrics.

The intervention randomized 7,686 of roughly 8,181 German postal codes into control or treatment over a 14-day campaign, with a 2x2 factorial on ad content (empathy vs effectiveness) and impression allocation (Facebook free allocation vs fixed per–postal-code budgets). Outcomes were measured at the postal-code-by-day level and crucially cover Save the Children’s total donations across all channels, not just click-throughs, with 31 days pre, 14 during, and 38 post (and some robustness using 10 days of January). The main results show statistically meaningful increases in donation frequency both during and long after the campaign; revenue effects are positive and borderline-significant over the combined during+post window, and not significant in the short term. The paper also provides evidence of crowd-out for other charities (negative effects in competitor datasets), documents spillovers to nearby untreated postal codes, and shows that short-run click/attention metrics favor the empathy video but do not translate into superior long-run giving. The design and execution are careful and impressively scaled, but several limitations and interpretive cautions remain.\\n\\nKey identification and measurement issues:\\n- SUTVA/spillovers: The authors detect positive spillovers from treated to untreated areas (within 30 km), implying the main ITT estimates are lower bounds for total effects on giving to the focal charity. This strengthens the claim that ads raise giving to the focal charity but complicates the interpretation of magnitudes, especially for the decomposition and competitor analyses. The spillover specification is cross-sectional and may still pick up spatial confounding; it would benefit from pre-registered spatial models and placebo checks.\\n- Partial exposure and dose: Only about one in ten Facebook users in treated postal codes received at least one impression; intensity varies across postal codes and treatments, and click data are semi-aggregated for the free-allocation arm. The study reports ITT effects but provides limited exploitation of variation in impressions to recover dose–response or treatment-on-the-treated effects. Given available impression counts, an IV or continuous treatment analysis could have triangulated effect sizes and validated the ITT magnitudes.\\n- Aggregation and winsorization: Outcomes are aggregated to PLZ-day, with winsorization at €1,000 for PLZ-day sums. Heavy-tailed gifts can meaningfully affect revenue estimates; while the authors report similar results without winsorization, the paper relies on the winsorized specification for precision. Because most outcome analyses aggregate to period totals and normalize per million inhabitants per day, a small number of large donations could still influence estimates; supplemental medians, quantile, or count models would help demonstrate robustness of distributional claims (beyond the helpful histogram-based evidence on donation-size categories).\\n- Pretreatment differences and modeling choices: Pretreatment imbalances are non-significant for Save the Children outcomes but significant for the 23-charity alliance data. The preferred specifications include lagged outcomes, fixed effects (where applicable), and DiD. This is appropriate, but given multiple datasets and outcomes, a consistent DiD framework (with pre-trends visualizations) would strengthen comparability and reduce ambiguity about model-dependent results.\\n- Competitor effects: Evidence of crowd-out relies on online-only donations for the 23-charity alliance and project categories on a donation platform for the second dataset. The former omits offline giving (unlike the focal charity data), the latter uses project tags (children-related vs other) with potential misclassification and multiple tagging. Several key coefficients are only marginally significant (p<0.10), and there are many tests without multiple-comparison adjustments. The paper states crowd-out cautiously, but its magnitude and scope remain uncertain. Concurrent campaigns by other organizations or auction-market interference on Facebook could be part of the mechanism; these are not directly disentangled from donor-budget substitution.\\n- Profitability estimation: The immediate revenue–to–ad-spend ratio is 1.45 based on point estimates, but the 90% CI is wide and includes substantially lower values. The long-run ROI assumes a lifetime multiplier of 1.75 for new donors and similar persistence for existing donors; this is plausible but not estimated from the experiment. The cost side excludes potential fixed costs (creative, management) and processing fees. The profitability conclusion should be framed as “probable with wide uncertainty,” rather than definitive, and sensitivity analyses for alternative LTVs and cost structures would improve credibility.\\n- Pre-registration deviations: Blocking also used Facebook reach (not pre-specified), and the impression-allocation dimension was added. Excluding the top 1% and bottom 5% of Facebook reach also deviates from a pure census approach. These changes are well motivated (budget feasibility, power, and algorithmic allocation questions) and transparent, but they reduce the strength of strict pre-commitment.\\n- External validity: The experiment ran during the peak German giving season (mid-November through year-end); effects may differ outside this period or in other countries/platforms. The campaign was intentionally largely untargeted. While this increases generalizability to the population of Facebook users in Germany, it may understate effects achievable with standard fundraising targeting. The heterogeneity analysis shows substantial scope for targeting, supporting this point.\\n- Intermediate metrics vs outcomes: The paper’s conclusion that clicks and short-run attention are poor proxies for long-run donations is consistent with the presented comparisons, but the inability to trace individual click-to-donation conversions (due to tracking limitations) weakens causal linkage claims between specific intermediate metrics and outcomes. The empirical message remains strong but should be characterized as “indicative” rather than “conclusive” regarding mechanism.\\n- Statistical inference and presentation: Most core findings are robust and supported by randomization inference. However, many secondary analyses (competitors, heterogeneity splits, factorial arms) involve multiple hypothesis tests; the paper could report adjusted p-values or emphasize effect sizes with confidence intervals to guard against false positives.\\n- Reproducibility and open science: The study uses proprietary donation and platform data aggregated at PLZ-day and semi-aggregated ad metrics. The appendix is helpful, and the design was preregistered. However, the underlying data and code do not appear to be publicly available, limiting computational reproducibility and reanalysis. Clearer replication materials (synthetic data, code, detailed variable construction) would substantially raise the paper’s value as a building block.\\n\\nOverall, this is a credible, policy-relevant, and unusually well-powered field experiment addressing an important question. The strongest contributions are: (i) measuring total donations across all channels, mitigating common substitution and measurement biases; (ii) documenting persistent effects beyond the campaign; (iii) providing evidence of inter-charity crowd-out; and (iv) demonstrating that click/attention metrics can mislead campaign evaluation. The main reservations relate to the uncertainty around revenue magnitudes and ROI, the reliance on assumptions for lifetime value, the limits of competitor data and multiple testing, and the inability to estimate dose–response. These caveats are acknowledged and do not undermine the central conclusion that online video fundraising, even when broadly targeted, increases charitable giving to the focal charity. The paper is valuable for both academics and practitioners and is near the top of recent work in this space.\",\"metrics\":{\"overall\":{\"midpoint\":87,\"lower_bound\":87,\"upper_bound\":87},\"claims_evidence\":{\"midpoint\":83,\"lower_bound\":83,\"upper_bound\":83},\"methods\":{\"midpoint\":85,\"lower_bound\":85,\"upper_bound\":85},\"advancing_knowledge\":{\"midpoint\":79,\"lower_bound\":79,\"upper_bound\":79},\"logic_communication\":{\"midpoint\":90,\"lower_bound\":90,\"upper_bound\":90},\"open_science\":{\"midpoint\":55,\"lower_bound\":55,\"upper_bound\":55},\"global_relevance\":{\"midpoint\":78,\"lower_bound\":78,\"upper_bound\":78},\"tier_should\":{\"score\":4.1,\"ci_lower\":4.1,\"ci_upper\":4.1},\"tier_will\":{\"score\":3.8,\"ci_lower\":3.8,\"ci_upper\":3.8}}}",
