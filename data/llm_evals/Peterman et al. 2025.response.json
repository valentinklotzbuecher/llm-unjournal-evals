A small scale of g  0.1 coupled with high heterogeneity makes it hard to connect to policy significance, despite a few cost-benefit analyses provided.", "type": "summary_text"}, {"text": "**Reviewing method suggestions**\n\nI’m considering how to improve interpretability by converting to relative risk or proportions, particularly for binary outcomes.

They often look at youth versus adult demographics, noting that there aren't many older women represented nor a balance between urban and rural settings—this could skew their findings.  \n\nFinally, the classification of sample age groups seems approximate since they use share-of-sample averages, which might lead to misclassification.

The use of standardized mean differences combines continuous and binary data, limiting clear definitions.\n\nMultiplicity of effect sizes per study is another issue; while RVE addresses correlation, it doesn’t consider study-level quality.

The analytic strategy (standardized mean differences converted to Hedges’ g; robust variance estimation [RVE] to handle within-study dependence; multilevel RE and influential-point checks as robustness) is appropriate and largely well executed. That said, several features limit interpretability and design guidance. First, heterogeneity is extremely high throughout (I2 commonly 80–95%+; τ2 > 0.02), yet the paper emphasizes pooled mean effects without reporting prediction intervals or distributional summaries of true effects. Given the breadth of contexts, modalities, and outcomes, a single pooled g≈0.11 risks overgeneralizing and is of limited policy value without a sense of between-study dispersion and likely range in new settings. Meta-regressions recover few moderators and retain high residual heterogeneity, suggesting either limited power to detect realistic moderators, substantial measurement noise in moderator coding, or genuine context dependence. Second, outcome harmonization is ambitious but stretches conceptual comparability. “Economic achievements” and “agency” are multi-dimensional constructs; the paper pools across diverse indicators (including binary and continuous) via SMDs. Although standard, SMDs reduce interpretability for practitioners (e.g., how large is g=0.11 in hours worked or decision-making probability terms?) and may mix substantively different measures under a common metric. Additional stratification by measurement type (binary vs continuous; index vs single indicator) and presentation of effects in natural units where feasible would improve external usefulness. Relatedly, it is unclear whether aggregate indices and their constituent components were ever both included for the same sample/time; explicit safeguards against double-counting would be helpful. Third, the dependence structure is handled with RVE, but weighting details are under-specified (e.g., exact weight formula, assumed within-study correlation ρ, and sensitivity to alternative ρ values). With 1,307 effects from 93 studies, a few studies likely contribute disproportionate numbers of outcomes and time points; sensitivity checks that collapse to one effect per study per domain (or use study-level aggregates) would test robustness to outcome multiplicity. Fourth, moderator coding seems too coarse or noisy for strong design conclusions. For example, “value of benefits” is in nominal USD rather than PPP-adjusted or scaled by local consumption/baseline income; “scale of implementation” and “pilot vs mid-level vs at-scale” appear categorical with potential misclassification; “cash-plus” is highly heterogeneous; and “gender targeting” shows little variation. These choices attenuate power to detect gradients (e.g., dose–response with transfer size) and likely contribute to null moderator findings. Fifth, time dynamics are insufficiently interrogated: most interventions last ≈12 months with follow-up ≈14 months post-intervention; but SSN effects can accumulate or fade. While a simple <12 vs ≥12 months split is reported, more granular modeling (event time, longest vs earliest follow-up, or pre-specified primary horizon) would clarify durability. Sixth, although the authors state “little evidence of publication bias,” methods are not detailed in the main text, and standard small-study or funnel diagnostics are complicated by dependent effects; reporting study-level funnel plots, RVE-compatible Egger tests, or p-curve/p-uniform would strengthen this claim. Seventh, risk of bias/quality assessment is referenced (Table S4) and used as a control, but it does not appear to inform weights or stratified analyses; explicit RoB domains (randomization, attrition, selective reporting, measurement) and RoB-based sensitivity would increase credibility. Eighth, the cost-benefit synthesis is informative but limited: only ~25% of studies report BCR/IRR; methods and benefit definitions vary; most do not include women’s own economic gains or agency measures, making comparisons difficult and likely underestimating gender-specific value. A standardized re-analysis of costs/benefits where microdata are available (or harmonized assumptions) would be more decisive. Ninth, selection and generalizability: restricting to RCTs improves internal validity but may bias towards pilots and specific geographies (heavy in sub-Saharan Africa) and populations (few older women; fragile/urban underrepresented). The meta-regression’s “pilot lower than mid-level” result is suggestive but could reflect targeting differences; external validity remains a concern. Tenth, minor internal inconsistencies in reported point estimates/precision should be corrected (e.g., public works effect size appears as 0.127 elsewhere but 0.273 once; a decision-making CI is printed as 0.036–0.37). Finally, while the study states replication files will be public and provides supplementary materials, the data extraction instrument is not public, limiting auditability of coding and decisions (e.g., outcome inclusion/exclusion, direction coding, plus-component classification). Despite these issues, the conclusions are measured, the main claims (small positive effects on women’s outcomes overall, with UCTs/asset/social care robust; CCT and in-kind smaller) are consistent with the assembled evidence, and the paper adds substantial value by bringing together a broad experimental literature and by transparently acknowledging limits where moderators cannot be pinned down. Priority improvements: add prediction intervals; provide per-study-per-domain sensitivity; articulate RVE weighting/ρ and sensitivity; expand moderator measurement (PPP-normalized/consumption-scaled transfer size; clearer “plus” typology); deepen time-horizon analysis; present publication-bias diagnostics adapted to dependent effects; integrate RoB into weighting/stratification; and release the extraction protocol/instrument and a reproducible codebook linking each effect to its raw source and coding
