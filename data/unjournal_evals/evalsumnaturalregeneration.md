# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Global potential for
natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions\"[@nz8wn6xld0o].
From the evaluators' joint synthesis report "Williams et al. (2024) aim
to identify the magnitude and spatial distribution of biophysical
potential for natural forest regeneration\... Methodological concerns
fundamentally challenge the validity and utility of the central 215 Mha
estimate of regeneration potential." Key concerns include "data leakage
from contemporaneous predictors," "confounding by socioeconomic factors
and predictor choice" and "discrepancy in estimated magnitude and lack
of historical validation". Both evaluators suggest specific remedies; E2
also provides code for a bootstrap-based confusion matrix. These
evaluations are linked below; the [synthesis
report](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumnaturalregeneration#evaluators-synthesis-report "null")
is at the bottom of this document.

# **Overall ratings**[^1]

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^2])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^3]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

**Strengths**\
- Proposes an empirically novel approach to answer highly
policy-relevant questions\
- Provides a sound overall methodology which is tractable and replicable

**Critiques**\
- Trained model does not enable prediction into the future given
currently observed conditions\
- Predictions do not represent pure biophysical potential despite being
framed as such\
- Regrowth longevity is not addressed\
- Policy targeting implications qualified by additionality and
opportunity costs

## Evaluator 2 (Cannon Cloud)

This paper aims to model and predict the global potential for natural
regeneration in deforested tropical regions for 2016 and 2030,
respectively, using a machine learning random forest (RF) approach. The
study's aim and methods are novel and important, given the potential
benefits of natural regeneration on carbon sequestration (amongst many
other ecological and environmental outcomes) and the lack of
pan-tropical analysis. The paper\'s current estimates are the first we
have for understanding the scope of natural regeneration as an effective
climate change mitigation measure.\
\
However, my review identifies several significant conceptual and
methodological concerns that fundamentally affect the validity and
interpretability of the results and predictions, particularly concerning
the paper\'s goal of informing restoration prioritization.

# Evaluation manager's discussion/Process notes

## Why we chose this paper 

From the notes we shared with the evaluators:

> This paper looks at using machine learning to predict areas of forest
> that are regrowing naturally. This is important from a policy
> perspective: it is the UN decade of restoration; restoring forests is
> seen as key to meeting climate obligations; many countries have
> reforestation targets (eg Bolivia for 1m ha of forest regrowth).
> Understanding where and how much might happen naturally seems crucial,
> and in that sense, this paper offers compelling insights. For this
> very reason, it is important to be sure that the conclusions obtained
> are sound and robustly capture the actual relationships without
> biasing factors and data leakage.

## Evaluation process

We sought evaluators with demonstrated expertise in

-   the application of machine learning to economics and policy; issues
    like data leakage and causal inference, and

-   tropical forest ecology and restoration, climate change mitigation
    and carbon sequestration.

We suggested the evaluators may wish to specifically consider the
following issues:

> Although this paper was published in Nature, we would like to get
> independent feedback on a few aspects of it, particularly:
>
> -   Is there any "leakage" in the ML implementation (i.e. using
>     features that are related to the target and would not be available
>     in real-world use)?
>
> -   Inference: They are suggesting that the areas that should be
>     prioritised are those with a high predicted ability of regrowth --
>     is this correct? Do they make a clear and strong case for this?
>
> -   Additionality (i.e. the extent to which an intervention leads to
>     outcomes that would not have occurred in its absence).
>
> -   *What robustness checks/alternative specifications would you like
>     to see?*
>
> -   Have they chosen the most appropriate statistical learning
>     approach (random forests)?

We also checked that these issues had not been fully addressed by the
authors' responses to the peer review reports in Nature, which
(commendably) have been [publicly
shared](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08106-4/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8106_MOESM7_ESM.pdf "null").

After the evaluators returned their initial reports, we checked these
carefully, both from our own understanding and using AI reasoning
models, particularly considering and querying whether the issues raised
by the evaluator had already been addressed in the paper or its
appendices, or in the responses to the Nature peer review reports We
shared these responses with the evaluators, giving them the opportunity
to adjust.

We next consulted the authors, who declined to formally respond to these
evaluations. They suggested that "Many of the points raised by the
reviewers are addressed by reading the paper and its supplementary
material in more detail. In particular, the recommendations made by
reviewer 2 would likely be regarded as unpractical by experts who work
with remote sensing derived forest data." We checked these carefully
again, querying reasoning models and verifying their responses, and
sharing these with the evaluators. The consensus was that most of the
points were still relevant and were not addressed in the supplementary
material, nor in the responses to the Nature reviews. Most (but not all)
of the recommendations were deemed fairly practicable.

*As always, if they authors wish to respond in the future, we will share
their responses here.*

Because of the paper\'s prominence, we encouraged the evaluators to
share and discuss their reports with each other and seek consensus.
After extensive back-and-forth, they prepared the report below.

# Evaluators' synthesis report[^43]

## Introduction

Williams et al. (2024) [@n69ka59u04u]  aim to identify the magnitude and
spatial distribution of the biophysical potential for natural forest
regeneration (assuming socioeconomic factors are mitigated). After
discussing and re-evaluating the study, the evaluators agree on
significant methodological and interpretative issues. Methodological
concerns fundamentally challenge the validity and utility of the central
215 Mha estimate of regeneration potential.

## Primary Concerns

### 1. Data Leakage from Contemporaneous Predictors: 

The model induces data leakage due to predictors that are
contemporaneous with the outcome. Net primary production, burned area,
road density, and soil characteristics were recorded over the same time
period as the outcome, and these predictors incorporate information that
is influenced by regeneration itself. When predicting into the future,
information about these predictors is not available. As a result, the
reported model accuracy overstates true predictive performance. For a
more detailed discussion, see Evaluator 2\'s report, section \"[1. Data
Leakage
Concerns\"](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e2naturalregeneration#nv4smq6yoon "null").

### 2. Confounding by Socioeconomic Factors and Predictor Choice:

A considerable methodological challenge in identifying biophysical
regrowth potential arises from how socioeconomic constraints moderate
and are correlated with natural regeneration.

The trained model has learned from the entire domain of historical
regrowth and non-regrowth areas.  Regrowth historically happened only
where *both* biophysical factors and socioeconomic conditions were
favorable. As the model does not explicitly incorporate socioeconomic
conditions, it will tend to predict more regrowth when an area has
biophysical factors that tend to correlate with socioeconomic conditions
that favor regrowth.    Thus, contrary to what the authors argue,
dropping socioeconomic predictors *diminishes* the model's ability to
identify biophysical potential in isolation. Furthermore, retained
biophysical predictors such as 'distance to forest' and local forest
density are partially anthropogenically determined. In sum, the proposed
method cannot support the interpretation of the estimates as 'purely
biophysical potential for natural forest regrowth'.

### 3. Discrepancy in Estimated Magnitude and Lack of Historical Validation:

Because the model, as argued above, effectively estimates a combined
biophysical and socioeconomic potential due to highly correlated
predictors, its aggregate prediction should conceptually align with the
historical total observed under similar mixed influences. However, the
authors\' estimate of 215 Mha of expected natural regeneration is
strikingly larger than the benchmark from the training data by Fagan et
al. (2022) [@Fagan2022expansion] of 31.6 Mha ± 11.9 Mha (for 2000-2016),
even when accounting for increases in land availability due to
deforestation or uncaptured historical socioeconomic constraints.
Williams et al. (2024) do not report their own model\'s prediction for
the 2000-2016 historical period (a \"hindcast\"), a crucial missing
validation against this benchmark.

## Other Issues

Our review synthesis identified an additional important issue -- the
lack of transparency in how model accuracy was assessed, which in turn
undermines the ability to evaluate the 215 Mha estimate: 

\(i\) The confusion matrix in Table A1.2 appears to validate the model
by comparing its predictions for 2030 against the Fagan et al. (2022)
regrowth data for 2000-2016. However, the 215 Mha estimate is derived
from a prediction based on forest cover, forest density, and distance to
forest updated to reflect conditions in 2015 and 2018. This raises the
concern that validating a model designed to predict future potential
against past outcomes is not a true test of its predictive power for the
future. 

\(ii\) Table A1.2 reports 92% user\'s accuracy for the 215 Mha of
predicted regrowth, which implies at least \~197.8 Mha of regrowth in
ground truth and even more when considering omission error. The authors
do not provide any explicit detail about the size or nature of the
reference data and how it relates to the much smaller observed regrowth
(\~5.4 Mha) in the training dataset.\
\
Several other points raised in the individual evaluator reports further
undermine confidence in the conceptual basis, spatial distribution, and
overall magnitude of the estimates. These concerns, detailed in the
evaluator reports, include:

-   **Policy Implications, Additionality, and the Nature of
    \"Biophysical Potential\"**: Specific nuances in the policy
    implications drawn by Williams et al. (2024) are problematic. This
    includes issues concerning additionality, opportunity costs, and
    claims of \"low intervention effort,\" all of which are complicated
    by the unclear nature of the \"potential\" being mapped. The core
    problem is the lack of distinction between regrowth that would occur
    under a business-as-usual scenario and the \"potential\" that
    assumes socioeconomic constraints are overcome.

-   **Uncertainty Estimation**: The overly narrow confidence intervals
    reported for some estimates may not fully reflect the uncertainties
    introduced by the modeling choices and potential biases.

-   **Ephemerality of Forest Regrowth**: Concerns remain regarding how
    the short-term persistence of forest regrowth (often less than four
    years, as noted by Evaluator 1) is accounted for in estimates of
    long-term potential and carbon sequestration.

## IV. Conclusion {#iv-conclusion}

Due to the fundamental methodological issues outlined, the central
findings of Williams et al. (2024) are challenging to interpret and
reconcile with the underlying data. The evaluators recommend that
further inquiry into the topic address these issues where possible and
carefully consider how any unresolved limitations affect the
interpretation of results. This is essential to improving the scientific
understanding and evidence base that guide policy decisions.

[^8]: This rating reflects the paper\'s high potential and novelty
    tempered by severe methodological flaws that likely invalidate its
    main quantitative estimate (potential area) and compromise its
    predictive reliability. The midpoint below 50% reflects the current
    lack of credibility in the headline results. The wide CI reflects
    that the paper could be rated very poorly if the flaws are deemed
    insurmountable or very highly if major revisions successfully
    address the core issues, given the importance of the topic.

[^9]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\
    \
    This was on the newer form only

[^10]: The research questions are clearly identified and novel. The
    execution has a number of shortcomings which render the reliability
    of the results highly questionable. Results are incorrectly framed
    as pure biophysical potential.

[^11]: Original rating: (20, 40, 60)

[^12]: The paper clearly states its important questions and claims
    regarding natural regeneration potential. While the machine learning
    approach applied is novel and potentially powerful, the evidence
    provided for the main quantitative estimate (215 Mha) is
    significantly undermined by major methodological concerns,
    particularly the failure to correct for substantial omission errors
    in the input data and potential data leakage issues. Furthermore,
    the authors do not fully characterize the impact of these
    limitations on their results. This combination of clear goals but
    flawed evidence and characterization justifies a below-average
    midpoint rating (40%), while the wide credible interval (20-60%)
    reflects the tension between the paper\'s novelty and importance
    versus the current lack of credibility in its core findings, which
    could potentially be addressed through major revisions.

[^13]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^14]: Disregarding methodological critique, the study asks relevant
    research questions and provides a conceptually novel approach to
    answer them. As such, future research should build on the study and
    address the methodological shortcomings.

[^15]: Original rating: (40, 50, 90)

[^16]: This rating reflects the paper\'s high relevance to critical
    global priorities like climate change and biodiversity loss, and its
    potential to inform impactful interventions through cost-effective
    natural regeneration. The novel global approach represents a
    potentially significant contribution. However, the current
    contribution to practice is severely limited by major methodological
    concerns outlined in this review, particularly those affecting the
    reliability of the headline quantitative estimates and the map\'s
    utility for prioritization. These flaws substantially reduce the
    paper\'s current impact compared to its potential, justifying a
    midpoint rating. The wide credible interval acknowledges that
    successful major revisions addressing the core methodological issues
    could elevate the paper\'s contribution considerably.

[^17]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to
    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^18]: The overall methodology is well motivated and appropriate.
    However, shortcomings in implementation render the reliability of
    the results highly questionable.

[^19]: Original rating: (10, 30, 50)

[^20]: Adjusted rating comment: 'I would point out though this is just a
    simple mistake and overall they were pretty close, though this
    nuance doesn\'t show up in the rankings'.

    This rating reflects a significant disconnect between the clarity of
    the methods\' explanation and their appropriateness and robustness
    in practice. While the Random Forest approach is standard and
    described adequately, its application suffers from serious issues,
    including potential data leakage and, critically, the use of input
    data with known, large omission errors that are not corrected for in
    the final estimate. This leads to results that are likely biased,
    not robust to underlying assumptions, and presented without adequate
    characterization of the substantial uncertainty inherited from input
    data errors. These methodological shortcomings significantly
    undermine the credibility of the paper\'s main quantitative
    findings, justifying a low midpoint rating, although the wide
    credible interval acknowledges the potential for improvement if
    these fundamental issues were rigorously addressed.

[^21]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^22]: The method and its outputs are clearly defined. The conclusions
    and discussion are much more opaque and lack concrete policy
    prescriptions.

[^23]: Original rating: (50, 65, 80)

[^24]: This rating primarily assesses the clarity and internal
    consistency of the paper\'s presentation. The authors clearly define
    their core concepts and transparently explain their analytical
    reasoning and workflow. The conclusions drawn, such as the 215 Mha
    potential area, are consistent with the direct outputs of the
    specific modeling approach presented, and the supporting data,
    figures, and tables are relevant to the argument. However, the paper
    could more accurately characterize the nature of its evidence
    alongside its main claims by giving greater prominence to the known
    limitations of the input data (particularly omission errors) and
    their potential impact on the results\' interpretation, rather than
    primarily discussing these in the methods or supplementary
    information. Despite this weakness in fully contextualizing the
    evidence, the overall clarity and transparency warrant an
    above-average rating for this specific criterion.

[^25]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^26]: All data sources are referenced, publicly available, and the
    method is described in detail.

[^27]: Original rating: (15, 30, 45)

[^28]: The authors clearly explain their methodology and cite the
    sources for their input predictor variables. Furthermore, they make
    their final output maps (potential for regeneration) publicly
    available via Zenodo. However, direct replication of the analysis is
    severely hampered by the lack of publicly available code (available
    only upon request), and the absence of the derived training and
    validation dataset (the millions of points labeled as
    regeneration/non-regeneration). While the methods description is
    detailed, the inability for another researcher to easily access the
    exact code and training data to verify or build upon the modeling
    workflow significantly limits reproducibility and falls short.
    Therefore, despite the value of the output data, the overall support
    for replication and future analysis is rated below average.

[^29]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^30]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^31]: Disregarding methodological critique and the resulting caveats,
    the topic and results are highly relevant for policymakers and
    practicioners.

[^32]: Original rating: (50, 60, 70)

[^33]: The authors clearly define concepts as used in their study and
    transparently describe their analytical workflow. The main
    conclusions drawn, including the headline potential area estimate,
    are logically consistent with the evidence generated by their
    specific modeling approach, and the supporting data, figures, and
    tables are relevant and well-utilized (though sometimes missing).

[^34]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^35]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy

    benefits, etc.)?"

[^36]: Original rating: (50, 60, 70)

[^37]: The study is already published in a top journal. Impact potential
    and novelty clearly warrant this ranking, but methodological
    shortcomings and thin implications from the results do not carry
    that far. Methodologically better and more informative work is
    published in lower tier journals.

[^38]: I think this should be published in Nature if they can work
    through my main critiques. But if there is still some confusion
    about natural regrowth vs tree-planting, for example, or difficulty
    modeling uncertainty due to omission error, I would suggest this be
    moved down slightly in journal quality.

[^39]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^40]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^41]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^42]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\
    \

[^43]: See the above discussion of how we came to the evaluators\'
    synthesis.

    *3 Jun 2025*: The evaluation managers have added some stylistic
    edits that were approved by one but not both of the evaluators; we
    aim to revisit this.
