Walker et al. 2023,tier_should,4.3,3.8,4.7,"Strong, policy-relevant RCT evidence with novel intergenerational mortality outcome merits top field or marginal general-interest outlet (e.g., AEJ Applied, JDE, AER Insights, PNAS). Limits on mediation and measurement prevent clear top-5 general outlet."
Walker et al. 2023,tier_will,4.1,3.6,4.5,"Given author team and topic salience, likely in a top field or marginal A-level outlet. Debate around deworming and reporting/mediation limitations may temper chances at top general journals."
Weaver et al. 2025,tier_should,4.4,4.0,4.8,"Merits a top field/marginal A-journal (e.g., AEJ Applied, JDE, EJ, or possibly AER/RESTUD fringe) given scale, methods, and policy contribution. Null anthropometric averages temper general-interest appeal but sanitation heterogeneity and functional gains are significant."
Weaver et al. 2025,tier_will,4.2,3.8,4.6,Likely placement in a top field or marginal general-interest outlet. Author team and policy relevance increase odds; COVID-related data gaps and average nulls on primary anthropometrics may steer away from very top general journals.
Williams et al. 2024,tier_should,4.6,4.2,4.9,"Interdisciplinary, globally relevant advance with strong empirical basis and clear policy implications merits a marginal A-journal or top field journal. Small methodological caveats and partial openness modestly constrain ceiling."
Williams et al. 2024,tier_will,4.3,3.8,4.7,"Likely placement in top field (e.g., conservation/global change) or marginal A-journal given broad interest and policy salience; acceptance sensitive to reviewer views on stationarity, leakage/additionality, and mixed-resolution inputs."
Xing et al. 2023,tier_should,4.3,3.8,4.7,"Merits a top field/marginal general-interest econ outlet given methodological rigor, novelty, and policy relevance. Could fit AEJ: Applied, JPubE, JEEM, or top urban/environmental journals; with sharpening of identification and OS materials, could stretch to a general journal."
Xing et al. 2023,tier_will,3.9,3.3,4.4,"Likely outcome is a strong top field or marginal A journal in environmental/urban/applied micro (e.g., JEEM, AEJ: Applied, Journal of Urban Economics). General journals possible but less likely given scope and data limitations."
