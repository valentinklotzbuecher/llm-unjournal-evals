Xing et al. 2023,claims_evidence,90.0,82.0,96.0,"Core claims are precise and supported by convergent evidence: satellite NDVI/AOD, in-situ monitors, wind directivity, and ER claims data. Strong placebo and robustness checks. Some reliance on OLS for health elasticities and composite marginalization may leave residual confounding and measurement concerns."
Xing et al. 2023,methods,88.0,80.0,94.0,"Careful design addressing interference via upwind vs downwind, rich fixed effects, event studies, sensitivity to cone/radius. Clear link Policy→Green→Env→Health. Limits: some steps use OLS not IV; potential NDVI–AOD shared-source issue acknowledged; medical categorization via drugs may misclassify diagnoses."
Xing et al. 2023,advancing_knowledge,92.0,85.0,97.0,Novel integrated assessment of urban forests’ dual environmental-health effects at city scale with credible causal design; provides actionable species-level insights and cost-benefit framing. Bridges econ with atmospheric science and public health; useful for urban policy and green infrastructure planning.
Xing et al. 2023,logic_communication,89.0,82.0,95.0,"Clear articulation of framework, assumptions, and steps; figures/tables informative; limitations transparently discussed. Dense in places and some technical choices could be further justified, but overall reasoning is coherent and conclusions match evidence."
Xing et al. 2023,open_science,70.0,58.0,82.0,"Uses largely public RS and monitor data, but key administrative claims data and digitized MMP polygons may not be fully shareable; replication package not evident. Good methodological transparency; could improve by releasing code, derived datasets, and shapefiles where permitted."
Xing et al. 2023,global_relevance,94.0,88.0,98.0,High policy relevance for rapidly urbanizing regions and cities pursuing green infrastructure. Quantifies trade-offs and health impacts with transferable methodology. Offers species guidance and population targeting; broadly applicable beyond Beijing.
