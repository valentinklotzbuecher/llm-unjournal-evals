The logic and communication in the paper are strong; it's long but well-structured and clear, so I’ll give it 90 as well. They advance knowledge significantly with their novel statistics integration and comprehensive policy rankings, landing a 95. Overall, I find it around 93.

The logic and communication in the paper are strong—well-written, clear tables and figures. The knowledge advancement looks solid too; contract design enhances effectiveness, especially in LMICs. 

For global relevance, it's particularly high for India's air pollution, so I’d say it's a high percentile. Methods are high but not flawless due to potential biases.
