The main outcome is the annual count of active social‑revolutionary groups from a pre‑1950 terrorism dataset; the key regressor is a V‑Dem expert‑coded index of political power distribution by socioeconomic position (sign‑reversed so higher values mean greater exclusion). The empirical core is a two‑way fixed‑effects OLS design with Driscoll–Kraay standard errors, supplemented by an IV strategy that instruments local exclusion with the average exclusion in the same world region (excluding the focal country). The authors run numerous robustness checks: alternative dependent variables (per‑capita counts, inverse hyperbolic sine, binary activity, group formation), alternative class‑cleavage measures (civil‑liberties discrimination, unequal access to public services/jobs/business, and a composite index), additional controls (natural disasters, education, state involvement), nonlinearity tests, and adjustments to address potential regional trending in the IV setup. The main finding—a positive association between exclusion of the poor and social‑revolutionary terrorism—is persistent, and no comparable relationship appears for nationalist, right‑wing, or religious terrorism.\\n\\nKey strengths: (i) Timely and clearly framed question with plausible mechanism grounded in rational‑choice and grievance/relative deprivation perspectives. (ii) Rare use of pre‑1970 terrorism data, filling a gap and enabling historical comparisons. (iii) Careful panel specification with country and year fixed effects, attention to cross‑sectional dependence, and transparent reporting of estimates. (iv) Extensive robustness work, including multiple operationalizations of both the outcome and the focal regressor, and comparison across ideologies that functions as a placebo test. (v) Replication materials and use of public data sources make reproduction feasible.\\n\\nMain limitations and identification risks: (1) Measurement of the dependent variable. The outcome is the number of active groups rather than attacks or casualties; this may capture organizational proliferation more than intensity, and differences in how groups are counted or named. The data are likely sparse with many zeros and small counts, which raises distributional concerns for linear OLS. The paper partially addresses this via binary and asinh transformations and a group‑formation onset measure, but does not estimate count models with fixed effects (e.g., conditional Poisson), nor assess zero‑inflation explicitly. This choice could affect efficiency and possibly inference; showing that FE Poisson results align would further bolster credibility.\\n\\n(2) Measurement of the key regressor. The V‑Dem class‑power index relies on expert coding and item response models; measurement error—especially for the 19th century—may be nontrivial. The authors acknowledge potential attenuation; the IV approach mitigates this but hinges on strong assumptions. Relatedly, life expectancy is used as the main development proxy due to data constraints; while understandable, it may capture mortality crises and wars as well as development, and might mediate the effect of exclusion. Additional controls for industrialization/urbanization (only partially approximated later) would help reduce omitted variable bias.\\n\\n(3) Endogeneity and the IV strategy. Using regional average exclusion as an instrument raises exclusion‑restriction concerns: cross‑border diffusion of anarchist/leftist networks, region‑wide shocks (empire formation/dissolution, war mobilization, decolonization, legal changes), and region‑level democratization may directly affect local terrorism independent of local exclusion. The authors try to neutralize this by: removing potentially collinear controls, adding regional trends for democracy/autonomy and regional means of several covariates, and even including mean regional terrorism. First‑stage F statistics are strong, and Anderson–Rubin confidence sets support non‑weak inference. Nonetheless, with a single aggregated instrument, residual correlation between regional exclusion and local terrorism through unobserved regional shocks remains a live possibility. A leave‑one‑region‑out analysis or alternative instruments (e.g., historical franchise reforms, suffrage expansions, or settler institutions) would further strengthen causal claims.\\n\\n(4) Dynamics and timing. Most specifications use contemporaneous exclusion. If political inclusion reforms produce lagged changes in group activity, or if terrorism prompts reforms with a delay, estimates could be biased. While a lagged dependent variable is tested in robustness, lag structures for exclusion are not explored systematically (e.g., distributed lags or leads to test pre‑trends). Event‑study style checks around major enfranchisement or labor‑law reforms would clarify dynamics and mitigate reverse causality concerns.\\n\\n(5) Controls and potential over/under‑control. Democracy and domestic autonomy may be conceptually close to political exclusion and could lie on the causal pathway; including them risks absorbing part of the effect of interest or inducing post‑treatment bias, whereas omitting them risks omitted variable bias. The paper shows robustness across specifications, but a directed acyclic graph (DAG) or explicit mediation analysis could clarify which specifications should be interpreted as total vs. direct effects. Additional plausible confounders (union density, strike frequency, industrial employment share, urbanization rates) are largely unavailable for the full period but, where feasible, would be valuable sensitivity checks.\\n\\n(6) External validity and scope. Africa is excluded for data reasons, colonies and dominions are handled via a domestic autonomy index, and classification of groups may vary by archival coverage. These choices are well‑motivated but limit generalizability and could introduce selection if data coverage correlates with both exclusion and terrorism. The authors partly address this by including autonomy and discrimination indices, but a discussion of coverage bias in the Old Terrorism Dataset and V‑Dem for early periods would help readers calibrate inference.\\n\\n(7) Interpretation and magnitudes. The paper focuses on statistical significance. Substantive interpretation of effect sizes is limited; translating coefficients into probabilities of any group being active or into changes in expected group counts for realistic shifts in exclusion would help readers assess practical importance. Heterogeneity by baseline level of development or regime type is not explored beyond nonlinear checks; interactions might reveal where exclusion is most consequential.\\n\\nCommunication and transparency are generally strong: the argument is clear, data sources and construction steps are described, tables and figures are interpretable, and numerous appendices document robustness. Replication materials are available via a data repository, which aids reproducibility. Overall, the paper provides credible, carefully triangulated evidence that political exclusion of the poor is linked to social‑revolutionary terrorism in 1860–1950. The central identification step—regional‑trends IV—remains the most debatable element, and the distributional choice for counts is a secondary methodological limitation. Neither seems fatal; however, future work could solidify causality with alternative instruments, dynamic designs, and count‑model estimators, and reinforce mechanism tests by examining reform episodes and labor‑movement covariates.\",\"metrics\":{\"overall\":{\"midpoint\":72,\"lower_bound\":60,\"upper_bound\":82},\"claims_evidence\":{\"midpoint\":75,\"lower_bound\":62,\"upper_bound\":86},\"methods\":{\"midpoint\":68,\"lower_bound\":55,\"upper_bound\":80},\"advancing_knowledge\":{\"midpoint\":70,\"lower_bound\":58,\"upper_bound\":82},\"logic_communication\":{\"midpoint\":84,\"lower_bound\":74,\"upper_bound\":92},\"open_science\":{\"midpoint\":86,\"lower_bound\":76,\"upper_bound\":94},\"global_relevance\":{\"midpoint\":56,\"lower_bound\":40,\"upper_bound\":70},\"tier_should\":{\"score\":3.6,\"ci_lower\":3.0,\"ci_upper\":4.2},\"tier_will\":{\"score\":3.2,\"ci_lower\":2.6,\"ci_upper\":3.8}}}",
