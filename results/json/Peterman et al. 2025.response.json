The work follows a registered protocol (PROSPERO) and PRISMA, uses robust variance estimation (RVE) for dependent effects with small-sample adjustments, triangulates with a multilevel random-effects model, and provides extensive descriptive characterization of studies, interventions, and outcomes. However, several important issues warrant attention. First, heterogeneity is very high (I2 mostly 80–95%, tau2 > 0.02), yet pooled averages are emphasized as “robust” without providing prediction intervals; this means that while the mean effect is precisely estimated, the expected range of effects in a new setting is likely wide and often uncertain, which matters for external validity and for decision-makers comparing modalities and contexts. Relatedly, meta-regressions explain little of the heterogeneity and have limited degrees of freedom (df just above 4 threshold in some cases), making moderator inferences fragile; the paper acknowledges low power and heterogeneity but could more explicitly temper generalizations about modality differences (e.g., UCT > CCT) and the practical significance of pooled estimates. Second, outcome harmonization raises comparability concerns. The review collapses conceptually diverse constructs (e.g., labor force participation, savings, assets, expenditures; voice, autonomy, decision-making) into standardized mean differences (Hedges’ g). Many outcomes are binary (e.g., LFP), some are indices, and others continuous; the paper does not describe in the main text how binary outcomes and indices were transformed to SMDs, nor how differing variances and measurement properties across constructs were handled. Without clear transformation formulas and sensitivity to alternative metrics (e.g., log odds ratios for binaries, standardized indices only), comparability and interpretability of pooled Hedges’ g across such heterogeneous measures is limited. Third, dependence and weighting deserve more transparency. While RVE addresses within-study dependence, the manuscript does not detail the assumed correlation structure or ρ choice used for weights (and whether results are sensitive to ρ), nor quantify the extent to which large multi-arm or multi-outcome studies contribute disproportionate leverage. The Cook’s D influence check is helpful, but the criterion for flagging and the effect on pooled estimates should be documented quantitatively. Fourth, there are minor internal inconsistencies/typos that need correction: public works’ pooled effect is reported as 0.127 in one place and 0.273 elsewhere; a decision-making CI appears as [0.036–0.37], which likely omits a leading zero (0.137). Such inconsistencies, while not undermining the core conclusions, should be corrected for clarity and credibility. Fifth, the paper includes only experimental (RCT) evidence published 2003–2024 and searched in English/French/Spanish, but ultimately notes that no French or Spanish studies were included. It is unclear whether this reflects a true paucity or limitations in search strategy/screening; the exclusion of high-quality quasi-experimental studies and the effective English-only inclusion can constrain generalizability, particularly for Latin America where CCTs were historically prominent. Sixth, risk-of-bias/quality appraisal is not transparently summarized in the main text. The meta-regressions include an indicator for “quality assurance (medium quality)” with little explanation, and there is no synthesis of randomization integrity, attrition, spillovers, or outcome measurement bias across studies; readers would benefit from a clear figure/table summarizing risk-of-bias domains and any sensitivity analyses that down-weight or exclude high-risk studies. Seventh, moderator coding could be more granular for design features often posited to affect women’s outcomes (e.g., payment to whom; transfer frequency; delivery modality; conditionality enforcement intensity; childcare or reduction-of-time-cost components; norms context; plus-component content and dosage). The paper codes “plus” components broadly and finds limited moderator effects, but heterogeneity within categories (especially “training or information” and “gender-sensitive plus”) is substantial; more detailed taxonomy or hierarchical models distinguishing content, intensity, and timing would have more power to detect design–effect relationships. Eighth, the cost–benefit section is informative but methodologically thin for meta-analytic purposes. Measures (BCR, IRR, cost-effectiveness) vary in perspective, time horizon, discount rate, benefit definitions, and inclusion/exclusion of women-specific benefits; there is no standardization or meta-analytic synthesis, and comparability is limited. The claim that reported BCRs are “likely lower bounds” because women’s benefits are undercounted is plausible but remains speculative without re-estimation under common assumptions; a structured re-calculation for a subset with microdata would strengthen this section. Ninth, the orientation of “improvements” to ensure positive signs is sensible, but more detail is needed for outcomes where improvements imply decreases (e.g., debt, care-work intensity); explicitly stating for each indicator whether a decrease was coded as positive would help replication. Tenth, time dynamics are underexplored: intervention duration and follow-up are dichotomized at 12 months, but impacts of SSNs plausibly evolve; modeling time since last payment, cumulative value received, or longer-term follow-up with continuous functions or splines could be more informative. Eleventh, publication bias assessment is only referenced as “little evidence,” with details presumably in the supplement; funnel plots, small-study tests adapted for dependent effects, and p-curve/p-uniform analyses could be summarized in the main text to reassure readers. Twelfth, outcome selection could be subject to within-study reporting biases (e.g., studies more likely to report gendered outcomes when expecting positive effects); this is mentioned but not probed—pre-specification checks against original protocols or balance tests of outcome families would help. Finally, while the paper’s conclusions are appropriately cautious in places, some policy implications (e.g., advocating unconditionality over conditionality) could be more explicitly framed as suggestive given unresolved confounding of modality with geography, age of programs, enforcement intensity, and measurement choices; the authors note these limitations but the abstract and headline statements might overstate certainty. On transparency and reproducibility, replication files are said to be available as supplementary materials and to be deposited publicly upon acceptance; the data extraction form is not public, which is a notable barrier to full reproducibility because effect-level coding decisions (outcome mapping, sign conventions, index composition) are central to the results. Overall, this is a timely, thorough, and careful synthesis with clearly positive contributions; addressing the above issues—especially clarifying outcome transformations, correcting inconsistencies, adding prediction intervals, summarizing risk-of-bias, and strengthening the moderator taxonomy—would materially enhance credibility and practical usefulness for policy design.\",\"metrics\":{\"overall\":{\"midpoint\":84,\"lower_bound\":76,\"upper_bound\":92},\"claims_evidence\":{\"midpoint\":83,\"lower_bound\":75,\"upper_bound\":90},\"methods\":{\"midpoint\":78,\"lower_bound\":68,\"upper_bound\":86},\"advancing_knowledge\":{\"midpoint\":86,\"lower_bound\":78,\"upper_bound\":93},\"logic_communication\":{\"midpoint\":81,\"lower_bound\":72,\"upper_bound\":89},\"open_science\":{\"midpoint\":67,\"lower_bound\":55,\"upper_bound\":78},\"global_relevance\":{\"midpoint\":91,\"lower_bound\":85,\"upper_bound\":96},\"tier_should\":{\"score\":4.3,\"ci_lower\":3.7,\"ci_upper\":4.8},\"tier_will\":{\"score\":4.1,\"ci_lower\":3.3,\"ci_upper\":4.7}}}",
