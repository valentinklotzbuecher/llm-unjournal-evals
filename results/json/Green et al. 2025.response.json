The authors code 112 interventions from 41 studies (~87,000 participants) and use robust variance estimation (RVE) to account for within-study dependence. The main quantitative result—a small pooled standardized mean difference (SMD ≈ 0.07, 95% CI [0.02, 0.12]) for net MAP consumption—with publication-bias-adjusted estimates near zero, contrasts with more optimistic prior syntheses that mixed intentions/attitudes and non-randomized designs. They also distinguish interventions targeting red and processed meat (RPM), which show larger effects (SMD ≈ 0.25), and argue this likely overstates net MAP reduction because of plausible substitution to poultry/fish. The paper is timely, policy-relevant, and generally careful in interpretation. That said, several methodological and reporting choices merit clarification or revision.\\n\\nStudy identification and inclusion: The search is pragmatic and multi-pronged (reviews, citation chasing, crowdsourcing, targeted search terms, an AI tool, and nonprofit databases). However, the restriction to English may introduce language bias. It would help to quantify the contribution of gray literature among included RCTs and to document screening inter-rater reliability; as written, data extraction and inclusion decisions were primarily performed by one author, which raises error risk and subjective bias. The PRISMA diagram is provided, but a fuller accounting of reasons for exclusion at full-text stage would improve transparency. The requirement of a pure control is defensible but excludes some common cafeteria-level interventions where “usual practice” or partial exposure forms the counterfactual; the authors partly address this via a “marginal studies” sensitivity, but the implications for external validity could be emphasized.\\n\\nOutcome selection and measurement validity: Restricting to behavioral outcomes measured ≥1 day post-treatment is a major strength. Yet, many included outcomes appear coarse (e.g., binary self-reports of reduction vs. no reduction) and self-reported, which are vulnerable to social desirability and recall bias, especially when messaging primes ethical or identity frames. The authors code self-report vs. objective assessment but do not stratify or adjust by this risk-of-bias dimension; reporting subgroup results (and whether effects are attenuated with objective measures) would be useful. The decision to use the longest follow-up per intervention is consistent with the paper’s emphasis on sustained change, but it may mix widely varying exposure “doses” and contexts. A sensitivity using the earliest non-immediate behavioral outcome could show whether effects decay.\\n\\nEffect-size computation and harmonization: The paper uses Glass’s Δ (treatment-control mean divided by control SD), reportedly the “pre-treatment control group” SD when available; this needs clarification. In most included RCTs there is no natural pre-treatment SD on exactly the same outcome measure used at follow-up, and using a baseline SD (if measured) may be inappropriate if outcomes change scale distributions or if the analysis uses post-only means. If the intended denominator is the post-treatment control SD (the more typical Glass’s Δ), the text should say so unambiguously. Where means and SDs are missing, conversions from coefficients/η²/z are standard; however, the imputation rule for “unspecified nulls” (setting the effect size to 0.01) is problematic. This assigns a positive effect where direction is unknown and could upwardly bias the pooled mean precisely in the range of small effects under study. A more neutral imputation (e.g., 0 with imputed variance based on study size) or exclusion with sensitivity analysis is preferable. The difference-in-proportions estimator for binary outcomes is reasonable, but details on aligning signs (so that positive values uniformly indicate reductions in MAP) should be explicit.\\n\\nDependence, clustering, and weighting: The main meta-analytic model uses RVE via robumeta with small-sample correction, appropriate for multiple interventions per study sharing a control. However, the paper does not report the assumed within-study correlation (ρ) or show sensitivity to alternative ρ values; robumeta’s weights can change markedly with ρ. More importantly, several studies are cluster-randomized. It is not explicit whether the effect-size variances were adjusted for clustering (design effects/ICC or cluster-level summaries). If not, those studies’ precision would be overstated and they would be overweighted. The minimum of 10 clusters helps but does not resolve variance mis-specification. The authors should confirm and, if needed, re-estimate vi using cluster-corrected SEs or design effects and demonstrate robustness.\\n\\nPublication bias and sensitivity: The use of selection models (favoring significant positive results) and the “worst-case” non-affirmative-only sensitivity are commendable, and the bias-adjusted pooled effects near zero strengthen the headline conclusion. Yet selection models and significance-funnel approaches in metafor assume independence of effect sizes; since interventions within a study share a control, dependency remains unless the analysis is aggregated to one effect per study or a multilevel selection approach is used. The authors should clarify whether selection analyses were performed on study-aggregated effects and, if not, provide an aggregated sensitivity. The significance-funnel plot is informative; adding a p-curve or caliper test would further triangulate.\\n\\nModerator and subset analyses: The categorization into four theories and the RPM vs. MAP split are conceptually valuable. Because interventions and messages often overlap across categories and a single study can contribute to multiple classifications, the authors prudently avoid causal meta-regressions on theory. Still, they report subgroup pooled estimates with very small samples in some cells (e.g., choice architecture: 3 estimates, CI extremely wide). This should be presented more cautiously (e.g., descriptive only) and, where possible, collapsed across similar mechanisms. The temporal decline in average effects is interesting; adding cumulative meta-analysis or meta-regressing effect size on publication year (study-level, one effect per study) would better visualize potential decline effects.\\n\\nScope and inference: The paper’s main claim—meaningful, sustained reductions in net MAP consumption via current behavioral interventions remain largely elusive—is supported by the evidence assembled under strict criteria, and the discussion acknowledges limitations, substitution, and external validity. The contrast with much larger estimates when relaxing inclusion criteria is persuasive. However, the normative framing “unsolved problem” should be bounded by the sample: RCTs with behavior assessed ≥1 day, minimum size, pure control, in mostly high-income settings. The scarcity of rigorous choice architecture RCTs with delayed outcomes is itself a finding but also a constraint on generalization. The paper is careful not to overclaim superiority of any theory, and it highlights promising under-tested interventions and measurement approaches.\\n\\nTransparency and reproducibility: The authors emphasize computational reproducibility (Rmarkdown, containerization) and provide a DOI to the code/data repository. That is exemplary. The main weaknesses are single-coder data extraction, limited reporting on coding reliability and adjudication procedures, and lack of a preregistered protocol. Adding an archived protocol (even post hoc), inter-rater checks on a subsample, and a full data/codebook mapping each effect-size computation would further strengthen replicability.\\n\\nOverall, this is a rigorous, policy-relevant synthesis with conservative conclusions, appropriate caution about moderators, and strong open-science practices. Addressing the flagged issues—especially the “unspecified null = 0.01” imputation, clarity on Glass’s Δ denominator, cluster adjustment in variances/weights, independence in publication-bias analyses, and additional risk-of-bias stratifications—would substantially increase confidence. Even with these caveats, the paper adds valuable clarity to a crowded literature and provides a realistic baseline for future trials and policy design.\",\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"overall\": {\n
