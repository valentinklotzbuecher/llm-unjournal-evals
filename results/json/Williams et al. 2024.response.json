The work is conceptually strong and practically useful, but several methodological and interpretive issues temper confidence in some quantitative claims. The dependent variable (NR presence) comes from a prior mapping product that the authors note has substantial omission error in humid biomes at the area-estimation level (producer’s accuracy ~18.7% when area-weighted, despite high user’s accuracy for detected patches). Because the model is trained on mapped occurrences, systematic omission of true NR areas—in regions where NR is common—can bias both model fitting and spatial extrapolation (e.g., underweighting conditions conducive to NR in wet tropics), potentially distorting variable effects and spatial predictions. The authors emphasize mapped accuracy and argue the distributional estimates are robust, but they do not propagate this training-data uncertainty into their area and carbon estimates.\\n\\nThe authors fit random forest models on ~6 million points, balanced between NR and non-NR, and ultimately predict with a biophysical-only model after showing little accuracy difference from models including socioeconomic predictors. This choice aligns with mapping “biophysical potential,” but it conflates potential with likelihood under human pressures. Excluding socioeconomic covariates increases risk that predictions will overestimate practically achievable NR in landscapes with high clearing pressure, tenure insecurity, or near-term market drivers. The paper is careful to frame results as potential rather than realized outcomes and discusses leakage, additionality, and persistence, but these distinctions are not reflected in the headline global area and carbon numbers.\\n\\nValidation and uncertainty quantification warrant caution. Reported global accuracy is 87.9% using a large, randomly sampled, class-balanced validation set. The authors attempt to examine spatial autocorrelation by stratifying validation by distance from training data; accuracy dips to ~81% at 2–2.5 km then rises, with lower accuracies in Southeast Asia. However, the main accuracy figure still derives from spatially random validation that is known to be optimistic for spatial ecological models. A proper spatial block cross-validation, or geographically structured k-fold with held-out regions, would likely yield lower accuracy and provide more realistic uncertainty for end users. The model outputs are treated as probabilities, and the expected area is computed by summing pixel area multiplied by predicted probability. Because random-forest “probabilities” learned from class-balanced data are generally not calibrated to true prevalence, the interpretation of these scores as probabilities is questionable. No calibration (e.g., Platt/isotonic scaling on an unbiased validation set) is reported, and prevalence correction is not addressed. This undermines the probabilistic interpretation and the expected-area calculation. The discrepancy between weighted expected area (215 Mha) and the >0.5-threshold area (263 Mha) highlights sensitivity to how probabilities are used; yet the study presents an unrealistically tight “CI” for the 215 Mha (214.78–215.22 Mha) that appears to reflect only numerical aggregation, not genuine model or data uncertainty. Similarly, the 23.4 Gt C (21.1–25.7 Gt) carbon range seems to derive from carbon accumulation layers, not from uncertainty in the NR mapping and modeling, and therefore understates true uncertainty substantially.\\n\\nPredictors and resolution mismatches are transparently described. Key drivers—distance to forest, local forest density, soils, bioclimatic axes—behave as expected and agree with ecological understanding. Nevertheless, the prediction grid is 30 m while several inputs are 300 m to 1 km or coarser, so many pixel-level differences reflect coarse inputs; the authors acknowledge this. The decision to use 2018 tree cover and 2015 land cover to represent “present (2015) and near-future (2030)” while assuming overall conditions from 2000–2016 creates some temporal inconsistency; no explicit 2030 scenario for climate or socioeconomic change is modeled, so “2030” should be interpreted as a static extrapolation under recent conditions rather than a forecast.\\n\\nThe study domain is defined liberally: within forest biomes (±25°) the non-NR area includes croplands, pastures, grasslands, shrublands, etc., excluding water/urban/bare and current forest. This choice reduces subjective screening but risks including some areas that are ecologically marginal for closed-forest recovery; the model is asked to down-weight them. The authors excluded explicitly non-forest biomes, which limits risks of afforestation of true savannas, yet biome boundaries are coarse and the ESA CCI class uncertainties are nontrivial. Results show strong concentration of potential near existing forests, which is ecologically plausible and policy-relevant.\\n\\nThe carbon accounting combines predicted NR potential with published 1 km carbon accumulation rates over 30 years, downscaled to 30 m and aggregated. Important limitations are acknowledged: belowground biomass is omitted (noted), permanence and additionality are uncertain, and leakage can erode gains. However, no attempt is made to adjust area or carbon for mapped model error, or to provide scenario ranges reflecting plausible policy, price, or disturbance regimes (fire/drought). Consequently, the quantitative claims about carbon are best read as biophysical maxima conditional on establishment and persistence, not as realizable mitigation potential.\\n\\nOn reproducibility, the underlying datasets are public and the 30 m probability rasters are openly shared via Zenodo as tiled products, which is valuable for practitioners. However, the analysis code is available only on request. Given the complexity of data preprocessing, variable selection, spatial sampling, and model fitting, public code and a full computational environment would materially improve reproducibility and enable independent re-estimation and sensitivity analysis.\\n\\nCommunication is generally clear. Figures effectively convey spatial patterns and key partial dependencies; the paper repeatedly cautions that maps indicate potential and that local decision-making, equity, and socioeconomics matter. Nonetheless, some statements risk over-interpretation: the use of “probability” for random forest scores learned under balanced sampling, the very narrow “confidence intervals” for area, and the lack of propagated uncertainty in carbon estimates could mislead nontechnical readers. The Discussion thoughtfully addresses persistence risks, perverse incentives, certification gaps, and equity, which enhances practical relevance.\\n\\nPriority methodological improvements that would strengthen the work include: (1) spatially explicit cross-validation with geographic blocks and reporting of region-specific performance; (2) probability calibration and prevalence correction, with alternative area estimates based on calibrated probabilities and multiple thresholds; (3) explicit uncertainty propagation from training data error, model error, and predictor uncertainty into area and carbon estimates; (4) side-by-side predictions with and without socioeconomic variables to bound “biophysical potential” versus “near-term likelihood”; (5) area-of-applicability diagnostics to flag extrapolations; and (6) full public release of code and workflows. Even with these caveats, the dataset fills a significant gap for restoration planning by mapping where natural regeneration is most biophysically favored at fine spatial resolution and by linking this to indicative carbon potential. Practitioners should treat the numbers as upper bounds and combine them with local data on land tenure, pressures, and costs when setting targets or designing
