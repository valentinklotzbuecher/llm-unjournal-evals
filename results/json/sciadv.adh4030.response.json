Although closure weeks align with grade levels, grade-track fixed effects are included to account for this. However, if certain grades, particularly higher ones, reopened earlier, it could create a different slope in mental health changes.

The main identification uses a two-way fixed-effects design leveraging within-state, across-grade/track and within–grade/track, across-state differences in mandated weeks without in-person schooling, with age and sex controls and extensive fixed effects. The authors conclude that each additional week of school closure worsened health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased psychosomatic, behavioral-emotional, and depressive symptoms (no detectable effect on anxiety), that effects were stronger for boys, younger adolescents, and those with limited living space, and that family problems were the predominant issue revealed in helpline calls; they further argue school closures largely explain the overall deterioration of youth mental health observed between the pre-pandemic and first-wave samples, albeit with wide confidence intervals.\\n\\nKey identification threats and data limitations are as follows. First, the main estimates come from a single cross-section during the first wave (COPSY) with variation in exposure generated by reopening schedules. While two-way fixed effects absorb state-level and grade/track-level differences, the design relies on the assumption that no other within-state, grade/track-specific shocks correlated with reopening sequences affected mental health. The logic is plausible since other policies were not grade-targeted; nevertheless, unobserved, grade-specific changes in school support, remote learning intensity, or local implementation that correlate with reopening priority could bias estimates. The paper mitigates this by adding state-level pandemic severity and policy stringency controls in a correlated random effects (Mundlak) framework; results are stable, but those controls cannot rule out grade-specific factors by state. Second, the pre-pandemic comparison relies on BELLA measured 2015–2017 in a different mode (computer-assisted, in-person) versus COPSY online in 2020. Secular trends and mode effects could confound the pre/post difference. The authors include time trend and seasonality checks and find little sensitivity, but the several-year gap and mode shift remain an important caveat when concluding that closures “largely explain” the deterioration. Relatedly, only two of the mental health scales are available pre-pandemic; the other three are standardized within COPSY, which complicates harmonized interpretation across measures.\\n\\nThird, exposure measurement is imperfect. “Weeks of closure” is defined up to the (unknown) individual COPSY interview date and is top-coded at the COPSY start date in baseline; an alternative uses the end date; and another adjusts for holidays; results are robust. However, the end of closure is defined as “partial reopening,” which may not capture the intensity of in-person schooling (e.g., hybrid schedules varying across schools/classes), implying classical measurement error likely attenuating estimates and leaving possible heterogeneity unobserved. Fourth, inference and clustering: standard errors are clustered at the treatment level (state×grade×track), which is appropriate conceptually, but the effective number of clusters may be moderate; no wild-cluster bootstrap is reported. Fifth, the COPSY analytic sample is n≈907 adolescents; sampling weights support representativeness on observables, but nonresponse/selection into online participation could bias results if correlated with both mental health and closure exposure within fixed-effect cells.\\n\\nSixth, the helpline analyses are suggestive rather than causal. The linking of callers to exposure uses age as a proxy for grade and the receiving center’s location as the state identifier, which may not precisely reflect the caller’s residence or school context. Topic coding is counselor-reported and calls considered are those that progressed to counseling, creating selection that may vary over time. The analysis shows compelling descriptive patterns (family-problem calls spiking when schools are closed and diverging between early vs. late returners), reinforced by an ARMA model with fortnight dummies; however, other contemporaneous changes (e.g., local news cycles, staggered reopenings of out-of-school activities) could contribute, and the median split on closure weeks is a coarse exposure metric.\\n\\nSeventh, heterogeneity analyses rely on interactions with discrete splits (e.g., living space per school-aged child above/below the median), which are interpretable but may mask continuous dose-response patterns; measurement of living space and the allocation of space among children are approximate. Eighth, the absence of an anxiety effect may reflect the timing (short-run, first wave) or measurement focus (generalized anxiety), and should be interpreted cautiously. Ninth, the large per-week effect magnitudes (e.g., ~0.11 SD per week on HRQoL) imply sizable cumulative impacts over the observed exposure range; while consistent with the pre/post differences, they depend on linearity over the 4.7–10.1 week window and may not extrapolate to later, longer closures—as the authors note. Tenth, external validity is limited: Germany’s first-wave context combined low adolescent case rates, specific reopening priorities by grade/track, and particular broader restrictions; the authors appropriately caution about cross-country generalization.\\n\\nInternal consistency and robustness are otherwise strong: estimates are stable across multiple specifications (e.g., alternative imputation of exposure, quadratic terms, parental-reported outcomes, absorbing state×track fixed effects), and adding state-level pandemic severity and detailed policy stringency measures does not change the closure effects; only one of 65 policy coefficients reaches 5% significance (on anxiety), limiting concerns about omitted, state-level policy confounds. Pre-pandemic mental health measures are uncorrelated with mandated closure duration, supporting quasi-exogeneity of exposure. Communication is clear and transparent; figures align with text; the logic linking design to assumptions is explicit; and the heterogeneity and helpline sections triangulate mechanisms (family stress). Replication barriers exist: the core microdata (COPSY/BELLA) and helpline data are restricted-access; the ordinance-derived school-closure dataset and aggregate policy data are available, but code availability is not explicitly documented. Overall, this is a careful, policy-relevant study with a credible identification strategy given available data, appropriately framed limitations, and strong but not definitive evidence that school closures directly worsened adolescent mental health in the short run and likely explain a substantial share of the observed deterioration during the first pandemic wave.\",\"metrics\":{\"overall\":{\"midpoint\":84,\"lower_bound\":75,\"upper_bound\":90},\"claims_evidence\":{\"midpoint\":82,\"lower_bound\":72,\"upper_bound\":88},\"methods\":{\"midpoint\":80,\"lower_bound\":70,\"upper_bound\":87},\"advancing_knowledge\":{\"midpoint\":83,\"lower_bound\":73,\"upper_bound\":90},\"logic_communication\":{\"midpoint\":88,\"lower_bound\":80,\"upper_bound\":94},\"open_science\":{\"midpoint\":50,\"lower_bound\":35,\"upper_bound\":60},\"global_relevance\":{\"midpoint\":80,\"lower_bound\":68,\"upper_bound\":90},\"tier_should\":{\"score\":4.3,\"ci_lower\":3.8,\"ci_upper\":4.7},\"tier_will\":{\"score\":4.2,\"ci_lower\":3.5,\"ci_upper\":4.8}}}",
