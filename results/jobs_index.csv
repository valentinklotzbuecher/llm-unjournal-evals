I'm exploring the ""time window"" method for estimating growth using IMF WEO and Goldman Sachs data, updated every five years. They anchor this with a 40-year window linked to deworming, resulting in an estimate of 3.3% growth. However, there are issues with composite CAGR and heavy reliance on Goldman Sachs’s techniques. Their open science aspects include shared calculations but lack replicability due to missing links. Though their review process involved experts, it’s not exhaustive, and the report serves more as a practical tool than a novel academic contribution."

I'm using the timeframe from October 10 to December 31, specifically looking at the 31 days before, 14 days of treatment from November 10 to November 23, and then 38 days post-treatment. I'm also gathering competitor data from 23 similar charities and examining various categories. The results indicate a short-term increase in donation frequency during the campaign and some long-term effects that show significance, though the revenue estimates aren’t as strong."

I need to incorporate details from a paper to justify the scores clearly. This means summarizing issues like internal threats, data limitations, and measurement methods. Specifically, the meta-analysis includes 35 papers, 41 studies, and around 87,000 subjects with some restrictions, focusing on RCTs measuring behavior at least a day post-intervention. It employs robust variance estimation and utilizes Glass's Delta for effect size estimation, although using a null of 0.01 seems questionable and is worth critiquing. We should also consider publication bias and selection models."

I’m thinking about how they used RVE to handle dependent estimates, but it seems like they still double-count tests. They possibly took a ""study-level cluster"" approach that may weigh each effect size by the number of effects per cluster. It concerns me that if some studies have many effect sizes, they could dominate the results. They didn’t include risk of bias ratings in the main text and seem to rely on a quality assessment score, which feels incomplete."

I'm exploring the potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical areas using machine learning. The study employs random forest models with biophysical and socio-economic variables and decides on a biophysical-only model due to similar accuracy results. Training involved 6 million random points, balancing between regenerated and non-regenerated areas, aiming to predict potential across the tropics at a 30m scale. They've quantified an area of 215 million hectares for regeneration and performed sensitivity analysis, noting some calculations produce larger areas than expected."
