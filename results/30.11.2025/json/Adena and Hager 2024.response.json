The core identification strategy—random assignment of almost all German postal codes (PLZs) to exposure or control, with additional 2x2 variation in video content (empathy vs effectiveness) and impression allocation (Facebook free allocation vs fixed PLZ budgets)—is strong. Outcomes are measured as total donations to the focal charity at the PLZ-day level across all channels, directly addressing common problems in ad-effectiveness studies (click-based selection, channel substitution, and unobserved offline giving). The study reports positive effects on donation frequency in both short and long horizons and a smaller but positive long-term effect on donation revenue; estimated immediate ROI is >1 and plausibly >2 in the longer run given assumptions about donor lifetime value. The design was preregistered, balance is shown, and several robustness checks (including Fisherian randomization inference and sensitivity to post-period length) are provided.\\n\\nThe most important methodological limitations concern exposure heterogeneity and spillovers. Treatment is assigned at the PLZ level, but impressions are probabilistic and sparse (roughly one in ten Facebook users in treated PLZs received at least one impression), so the estimates are ITT and likely attenuated relative to the effect of actually seeing the ad; the TOT is not estimated. The allocation strategy partly allows Facebook to endogenously concentrate impressions, creating within-treatment variation in exposure that is not exploited for causal TOT analysis (e.g., using randomized budgets as an instrument in a dose–response framework). Spillovers across PLZs are plausible (algorithmic leakage of geotargeting and social diffusion). The authors document positive “share of treated neighbors” effects and argue the main estimates are lower bounds, but the neighbor-treatment share is not itself randomized, and spatial correlation or common shocks could inflate these coefficients; the spillover analysis should be interpreted cautiously. Robustness to spatial correlation in errors is only partly addressed by robust standard errors and randomization inference; alternative SEs (e.g., spatial HAC or clustering at larger administrative units) and placebo geographies would further strengthen inference.\\n\\nData construction choices appear reasonable but introduce some judgment calls. Winsorizing PLZ-day donations at €1,000 reduces variance from heavy tails; the authors show that results are directionally robust, but precision trades off. Outcomes are scaled per million inhabitants per day, which largely equalizes variance across PLZs, but no explicit heteroskedastic weights are applied. The pre-period balance tables show small, nonsignificant differences; preferred specifications include lagged outcomes and block FEs, and difference-in-differences checks yield similar conclusions. Given the randomized design, these adjustments mainly improve precision. Reporting both ANCOVA and DiD estimates as main tables is helpful; preregistration notes some deviations (adding the allocation-strategy factor and including reach in blocking), which should be clearly tracked against pre-analysis plans for transparency; these deviations plausibly increase power but can raise concerns about researcher degrees of freedom.\\n\\nThe competitor/crowding-out analysis is an important contribution but faces data and identification constraints. The “23-charity alliance” dataset includes only online donations, not offline, and exhibits pretreatment imbalances, addressed with ANCOVA and DiD; effects on revenue are negative and sometimes significant, frequency effects are weaker. The Betterplace platform data exclude the focal charity but involve overlapping entities with the alliance and cover a broader set of projects; here the short-run interaction (children-related categories) is negative and significant on revenue while long-run results weaken. Overlap between sources and partial observability of the sector complicate aggregation; the paper correctly refrains from summing these effects. Nonetheless, the evidence is consistent with meaningful crowd-out among similar causes. Clarifying the base rates and providing standardized effect sizes (e.g., as a percent of baseline giving per PLZ-day) would aid interpretation. A placebo category less plausibly affected by the campaign (e.g., sports or animals) is used indirectly via the non-children grouping; sharper falsification tests (e.g., categories orthogonal to child/international relief) would further bolster the crowd-out claim.\\n\\nMechanism and design-variant results are well documented. Empathy videos generate more short-run attention and immediate donations, but long-run donation effects equalize with effectiveness-oriented videos, highlighting the danger of optimizing to clicks or short-watch metrics. Letting Facebook freely allocate impressions seems to perform at least as well as fixed PLZ budgets in both intermediate and longer-run outcomes; differences are not statistically large. These findings are valuable for practitioners but should be interpreted as specific to this campaign’s creative, audience, and season.\\n\\nThe profitability analysis is transparent yet assumption-sensitive. The immediate ROI calculation is straightforward, but the long-run multiplier of 1.75 relies on external retention estimates and assumes similar carryover for new and existing donors; it also excludes creative/overhead costs beyond media spend. Confidence intervals on monetary impacts are wide, and the point estimates rely on p<0.1 for revenue; presenting ROI distributions via parametric or bootstrap uncertainty propagation (combining outcome and cost variance) would improve decision relevance. Comparison to a hypothetical direct mail benchmark is informative, though based on stylized assumptions about response rates.\\n\\nExternal validity is high in several dimensions: nationwide scope, minimal individual targeting, and use of total donations across channels. Still, the context (Germany, late-year giving season, specific charity and creatives) limits portability. Heterogeneity analyses suggest stronger effects in urban areas and in PLZs with higher employment, more children, and more Catholics, and with higher predicted giving potential. These patterns can guide targeting but also indicate that the ITT estimates average over meaningful heterogeneity. Reporting treatment-on-potential-exposure effects (e.g., dose–response by observed impressions per capita in the fixed-budget arm) could add nuance.\\n\\nOpen-science practices are mixed. The design was preregistered on EGAP/OSF and the appendix is publicly hosted; however, code and analysis data are not provided (likely due to confidentiality), limiting reproducibility. The description of blocking, assignment, and all outcomes is detailed enough that a qualified team could replicate analyses if granted data access, but turnkey replication is not possible.\\n\\nOverall, the paper credibly demonstrates that a broad-reach social media fundraising campaign can increase total donations to a large charity and likely crowds out giving to similar causes. The empirical strategy is sound; the analyses are careful and transparent; and the practical lessons—avoid relying on clicks, expect competition effects, and consider algorithmic allocation—are valuable for practitioners. Main caveats relate to exposure heterogeneity, spatial spillover identification, sector-wide measurement for competitors, and ROI assumptions. The paper would benefit from additional spatially robust SEs, clearer pre-analysis plan deviation tracking, a formal uncertainty propagation for ROI, and stronger placebo tests in the spillover and crowd-out sections. Despite these limits, this is a strong and policy-relevant contribution to the literatures on charitable giving and digital advertising
